# Smart-Contracts
A bunch of smart contracts that can be used in day-to-day life are mentioned here.

Here, if you are stepping a stone into learning smart contracts or even if you are at an intermideate stage, you can try this smart contracts which are already complied to have a revision or get a better idea of how the things are going on. I have used functions like modifier, payable with comments mentioning the workflow of the respective contract. I hope you find it reviving.
